# Evaluation Framework

## Core Principle

The system is not considered successful because it makes money in one backtest. It must demonstrate reproducible risk-adjusted performance against simple baselines after realistic costs.

## Required Stages

### Stage 1 — Historical Backtest
- point-in-time data only
- explicit fees
- slippage model
- realistic latency assumptions
- delistings and missing-data treatment documented

### Stage 2 — Bias Controls
- look-ahead bias checks
- survivorship-bias review
- train/validation/holdout separation
- prompt/model version frozen per experiment

### Stage 3 — Walk-Forward Testing
Repeated out-of-sample windows with no parameter access to future periods.

### Stage 4 — Paper Trading
Run against live market data with simulated execution for a meaningful observation period.

### Stage 5 — Shadow Live
Generate the exact orders the production system would submit, but do not transmit them. Compare theoretical against market outcomes.

### Stage 6 — Tiny-Capital Pilot
Strictly capped capital and risk budget, with immediate rollback capability.

## Baselines

Every strategy must be compared against relevant simple baselines:
- BTC buy-and-hold
- ETH buy-and-hold
- BTC/ETH weighted portfolio
- simple time-series momentum
- simple moving-average trend strategy
- simple mean-reversion strategy
- volatility-targeted benchmark

## Metrics

Primary:
- CAGR / total return
- annualized volatility
- Sharpe ratio
- Sortino ratio
- maximum drawdown
- Calmar ratio
- profit factor
- expectancy per trade

Operational:
- turnover
- fees
- modeled and realized slippage
- fill rate
- rejected-order rate
- stale-data incidents
- provider failures
- LLM cost per decision / per unit PnL

## Attribution

Performance must be decomposed by:
- strategy
- asset
- market regime
- signal source
- model/prompt version
- long/short direction where applicable
- gross return versus fees/slippage

## Promotion Gate

No strategy advances to live capital solely on aggregate returns. Promotion requires acceptable out-of-sample behavior, bounded drawdown, stable attribution, operational reliability and no evidence of data leakage.
